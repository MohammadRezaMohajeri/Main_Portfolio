To change the color of "text selection" on a webpage (like the blue highlight or yellow), we can use the ::selection CSS pseudo-element. This allows you to customize the background and text color when the user highlights or selects text on your webpage. Here's how you can do it:


<head>
    <style>
        ::selection {
            background-color: yellow; /* Change this to any color you prefer */
            color: black; /* Change the text color if needed */
        }
    </style>
</head>






Explanation:
background-color: This sets the background color of the selected text.
color: This sets the text color of the selected text.
