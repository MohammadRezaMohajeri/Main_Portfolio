                    This page is dedicated to a Shiny application for analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The application is currently under development and will be available here soon. It is expected to be completed within 1-2 weeks.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The app will allow users to upload scRNA-seq files, perform exploratory data analysis, carry out preprocessing (QC filtering and normalization), select cell types of interest, identify highly variable genes (HVGs) based on cell types, and conduct functional analyses on the top HVGs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Once completed, the Shiny app and all related information will be accessible on this page. Please check back soon!
